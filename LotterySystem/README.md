# Limited Lottery System: A Fair Shot for All

Imagine an ecommerce website unveiling an exclusive lottery event for limited time, offering just **100 tickets**. Despite the limited time frame and ticket availability, the website anticipates a surge of eager participants, ranging from thousands to lakhs. How will the system manage this influx while ensuring fairness and efficiency for every hopeful participant? Join me as we explore the mechanics behind orchestrating this lottery experience.

### Leveraging ConcurrentLinkedQueue for Thread-Safe Operations

To handle concurrent access to ticket sales, we turn to Java's ConcurrentLinkedQueue. This class, part of the Java Collection Framework, provides a thread-safe implementation of a queue, allowing elements to be inserted and retrieved in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) manner. By utilizing ConcurrentLinkedQueue, we ensure that ticket sales can proceed smoothly, even amidst a flurry of simultaneous requests from users.

### Ensuring Atomicity with AtomicInteger
Maintaining the count of tickets sold and ticket numbers necessitates atomic operations to prevent data inconsistency in a multi-threaded environment. Enter AtomicInteger, a versatile tool for achieving atomic operations without the need for cumbersome synchronization. By encapsulating integer values within AtomicInteger, we can perform operations such as incrementing the ticket count with confidence, knowing that race conditions and data inconsistencies are effectively mitigated.
